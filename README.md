<h3> Why this project</h3>
<p>I built this page for my 4th project in the Code Institute course for the Diploma in Full Stack Software Development.<br>
I wanted to build a good looking website where the functionality for online booking of Personal Trainer sessions would be possible and where both the user and the owner of the site can get the information they need. As building an online booking for Personal Trainer Sessions will be one of my projects for my current job as well this fall I used the opportunity to talk to my boss for user stories and planning of the project. Key points that would be crutial for the real site has been a part of this project.<br></p>

  <li>Use images that fit the purpose</li>
  <li>Hoover function on menue items and buttons</li>
  <li>Icons for social media links insted of text</li>
